Titles are being written such that new titles are appended above the old.
The new titles need to completely replace the old.

Links are screwed up. External links are being created where internal ones
should be.

For some reason the entire first half of the wiki pages have been skipped.

It's time for some logging. It will be a good experience to learn how to set Up
logs.

Depending on the proceedure of how things are programed there is a possibility that heading1s
will collide with numbered text.
